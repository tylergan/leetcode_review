package graphs

/*
You have a graph of n nodes. You are given an integer n and an array edges where edges[i] = [a_i, b_i] indicates that there is an edge between a_i and b_i in the graph.

Return the number of connected components in the graph.

Example 1:

Input:
n = 5, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[3,4]]

Output: 2
Example 2:

Input:
n = 5, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]]

Output: 1
Constraints:

1 <= n <= 2000
1 <= edges.length <= 5000
edges[i].length == 2
0 <= a_i <= b_i < n
a_i != b_i
There are no repeated edges.
