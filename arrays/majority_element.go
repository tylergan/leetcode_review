/*
Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times in the array. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [5,5,1,1,1,5,5]

Output: 5

Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,2,2]

Output: 2

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 50,000
-1,000,000,000 <= nums[i] <= 1,000,000,000

Follow-up: Could you solve the problem in linear time and in O(1) space?

// Boyer-Moore voting: because the majority element appears more than n/2 times,
// pairing it off against every other element can never fully cancel it out. We
// keep a single candidate and a counter; matching votes increment, opposing
// votes decrement, and a zeroed counter lets the next element take over. The
// survivor is guaranteed to be the majority element.
func majorityElement(nums []int) int {
	majority, cnt := nums[0], 1
	for i := 1; i < len(nums); i++ {
		if majority == nums[i] {
			cnt++
			continue
		}

		cnt--
		if cnt == 0 {
			majority = nums[i]
			cnt = 1
		}
	}

	return majority
}
